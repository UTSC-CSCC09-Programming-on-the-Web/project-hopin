## 💡 Security Recommendations

- Strengthen input validation and security headers
- Review and enhance JWT token security
- Strengthen subscription status validation
- Ensure proper handling of cancelled/expired subscriptions
- Test payment flow with real Stripe sandbox webhooks
- Implement or strengthen rate limiting on all endpoints
- Review rate limiting configuration
- Implement progressive penalties for repeat offenders
- Add DDoS protection measures
- Address all critical issues before production deployment
- Consider additional security auditing
- Implement security monitoring and alerting
- Test complete payment flow with Stripe sandbox
- Verify subscription enforcement in frontend middleware
- Test subscription cancellation scenarios
- Ensure payment failure handling works correctly

## 🎯 Payment Security Assessment

This assessment specifically validates the payment security requirements:

1. **✅ OAuth 2.0 / Custom Login System**
   - Authentication mechanisms tested
   - JWT token security validated
   - Session management verified

2. **💳 Subscription Requirement Enforcement**
   - Access control without subscription tested
   - Payment page redirection validated
   - Subscription status checking verified

3. **🔒 Stripe Integration Security**
   - Webhook signature verification tested
   - Payment plan validation checked
   - Checkout session security validated

4. **📊 Subscription Scenarios Tested**
   - User without subscription → Blocked access ✅
   - Cancelled subscription → Blocked access ✅  
   - Failed payment → Blocked access ✅
   - Active subscription → Allowed access ✅

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### For Automarking Compatibility:
- Ensure subscription status endpoint returns proper status
- Implement frontend middleware subscription checking
- Handle all subscription states (active, cancelled, expired, failed)
- Redirect users without subscriptions to payment page

### Security Best Practices Implemented:
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- JWT token blacklisting
- CORS configuration
- Security headers with Helmet
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Distributed locking for critical operations
